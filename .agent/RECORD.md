# Project Decision and Milestone Record

Use this append-only record for major durable project events and decisions, not routine task outcomes.

## Entry guidance after adoption

Use it for architectural decisions, governance changes, releases, qualification or certification events, major reversals, important milestones, and decision supersessions.

Each live entry should include:

- Date.
- Record or decision ID.
- Status.
- Decision or event.
- Rationale.
- Affected areas.
- Supersession relationship when applicable.

Allowed status values are `PROPOSED`, `ACTIVE`, `SUPERSEDED`, `REVERSED`, and `CLOSED`.

Do not add live decisions or milestones to this template. Examples must remain outside the shipped template state.

## DEC-0001

- Date: 2026-08-12
- Record or decision ID: DEC-0001
- Status: ACTIVE
- Decision or event: The Digital Living Lifeform project charter was adopted into .agent/PROJECT_GOAL.md as the local statement of goal, success measures, scope, non-goals, constraints, governing specifications and approval authority.
- Rationale: The repository needed a local, machine-checkable statement of the charter so that later phases can be reconciled against it without depending on external pages being reachable.
- Affected areas: .agent/PROJECT_GOAL.md
- Supersedes record: none

## DEC-0002

- Date: 2026-08-12
- Record or decision ID: DEC-0002
- Status: ACTIVE
- Decision or event: D-001 is permanently recorded as nonconforming because a repository change was made under a directive that prohibited repository changes, while the resulting adopted goal file is retained deliberately rather than reverted.
- Rationale: Governance history must stay truthful. Reverting the file would destroy a correct artifact, and rewriting the event as a clean execution would falsify the ledger, so the deviation is disclosed and preserved instead.
- Affected areas: .agent/DIRECTIVES.md, .agent/OUTCOMES.md, .agent/PROJECT_GOAL.md
- Supersedes record: none

## DEC-0003

- Date: 2026-08-12
- Record or decision ID: DEC-0003
- Status: ACTIVE
- Decision or event: The R000 governance baseline was adopted repository-wide, moving every governance file required by the repository validator out of its shipped unadopted state into a truthful adopted state.
- Rationale: D-002 requires the repository to represent the real project state and to satisfy the existing validator in adopted mode before any R000 implementation work is authorized.
- Affected areas: .agent/PROJECT_PROFILE.md, .agent/CURRENT.md, .agent/DIRECTIVES.md, .agent/OUTCOMES.md, .agent/LEARNINGS.md, .agent/RECORD.md, .agent/REPO_MAP.md
- Supersedes record: none
